## What is Whisper Turbo?
Whisper Turbo intends to be a **drop-in** replacement for the OpenAI Whisper API. This is built up from 3 things:

1. A smooth compatibility layer for ingesting audio files of various formats and converting them to be Whisper compatible.
2. Developer-friendly APIs for one-shot inference and streaming.
3. The core Rust + WebGPU inference framework, Rumble, designed from the ground up for fast, cross-platform inference.

## Install
In alpha currently, use at your own risk.

```bash
npm install whisper-turbo
```

## Docs
Coming soon
