## What is Whisper Turbo?

Whisper Turbo intends to be a **drop-in** replacement for the OpenAI Whisper API. This is built up from 3 things:

1. A smooth compatibility layer for ingesting audio files of various formats and converting them to be Whisper compatible.
2. Developer-friendly APIs for one-shot inference and streaming.
3. The core Rust + WebGPU inference framework, Rumble, designed from the ground up for fast, cross-platform inference.

## RoadMap

Check out [the roadmap](https://github.com/users/FL33TW00D/projects/1).

## Supported Platforms

WebGPU is only currently available on stable release Chrome Version >= 113.
Firefox & Safari do not currently ship WebGPU.

Windows + MacOS are supported, Linux is not.

## Install

In alpha currently, use at your own risk.

```bash
npm install whisper-turbo
```

Coming soon
