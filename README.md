## What is Whisper Turbo?
Whisper Turbo is a lightning-fast, **cross-platform** Whisper implementation, designed to run entirely client-side in your browser or electron app.
Powered by a custom runtime written in Rust, WebAssembly & WebGPU, you can see ~20x real-time speeds.

Whisper-Turbo offers a few key benefits:
1. Real-time streaming (WIP) - simply speak into your microphone and watch the text appear in real-time like a sci-fi movie.
2. Completely private & offline.
3. Free!*

Check out [Getting Started]() for more.

## Supported Platforms

WebGPU is only officially supported on Chromium based browser running on Windows & MacOS, but is available behind
a feature flag on Linux. Check [here](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/wiki/Implementation-Status) for an up to
date implementation status.


## Getting Started 

In alpha currently, expect breaking changes.

```bash
npm install whisper-turbo
